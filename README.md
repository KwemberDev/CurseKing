### A non-intrusive adventure mod that adds content revolving around curses and blessing. Explore the wonderful alchemy of curses, slay remnants of fallen divinities, or summon an ancient spirit!

**Contents:**

*   Curses! Every mob has a small chance to spawn cursed; a cursed monster is slightly stronger. Killing a cursed mob has a chance to curse the player, curses negatively impact the players stats.
*   Blessings! Curses can be removed and purified. Absorbed blessings permanently buff the player!
*   Grave of the Forgotten Deity! A new biome, adding custom blocks, decorations, and of course a new mob: the Fallen Apostle!
*   A boss mob complete with custom attacks and animations: the Aqua Regia!


Nearly all of the mods content can be tweaked in the config, both via the file and via the Forge in-game mod menu.


**Requirement:**

*   This mod requires a mixinloader like mixinbooter, mixinbootstrat, or mixincompat.
*   This mod requires Geckolib.
